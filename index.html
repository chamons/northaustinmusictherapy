						<h3>What is Music Therapy?</h3>
						<p> Music therapy is an evidence-based and goal-directed process that uses musical interventions to address non-musical needs and improve functioning in areas such as cognition, attention, communication, motor skills, and social skills; in addition to improving mental and emotional health.</p>
						<p>Music therapy offers a unique approach to treatment as music stimulates all areas of the brain simultaneously, and is in fact the only sensory experience to do so.</p>
