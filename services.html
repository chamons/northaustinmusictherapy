<div class="collapse" id="individual-text">
<p>Individual music therapy sessions are tailored to each client's needs, abilities, and
musical preferences. A formal treatment plan is adopted based on an assessment, and
progress on specified goals and objectives is tracked and recorded after each one-on-one
session. Creative approaches and an emphasis on leveraging an individual’s strengths
create an engaging environment, while fostering success. Goal areas addressed may
include communication and speech, cognitive and academic skills, fine and gross motor
skills, social skills, reality orientation and memory recall, self-expression, emotional
expression and support, general well-being, and increased quality of life. Goals,
objectives, and interventions are designed to integrate well with other therapies and
generalize to daily activities. Individual music therapy sessions are 45 or 60 minutes
long and are scheduled on a weekly or bi-weekly basis as consistency is key in ensuring
effectiveness and progress. <a class="service-collapse-button" type="button" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#individual-text" aria-expanded="false" aria-controls="individual-text">Less &#x3E;&#x3E;</a></p>
